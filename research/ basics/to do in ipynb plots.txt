plot Earth-like planets accdg by filtering the ff params:

>radius
>temperature
>bulk composition
>stellar host type
>rotation rate
>companion moon
>big brother gas giant planet 
>geologic activity
>existence of water
>atmosphere composition

Blindly plot the mass and radius of planets (with available data) with uncertainties
Use clustering algorithm to get planet groups (perhaps refers to distinct planet regimes)
Get mass radius relation for each planet grouping
Different relations applies for different planet regimes (close-in, far-out)
Extrapolate the mass of the planet for each regime 


Radius and Teq
Regime convergence (transit+RV, imaging+RV, microlensing+RV+transit)
Extreme planets

Use Neural Nets to model the distribution of directly imaged exoplanets and compare it to the empirically-determined distribution for RV planets (see Brandt 2014)
Check plot semi-major axis vs. planetary radius and look for far-away (or long period) super-Earth/mini-Neptunes that can be interesting targets for or direct imaging

Explore the architecture (e.g. Kepler’s 3rd law still holds?) in multiple planetary systems

Reproduce exoplanet.org sample plots (see also plots of Hori-san)
http://th.nao.ac.jp/MEMBER/hori/pdf/HORI_2012Dec3-5.pdf

Super-Earths or mini-Neptune?

Overlap between RV and Transiting planets: plot mass and radius → density (solid, rocky, icy, thick atmosphere?)
