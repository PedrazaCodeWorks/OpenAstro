    "## Transit\n",
    "* The NIR data were calibrated by performing dark subtraction, readout pattern removal and flat division on the raw science images.\n",
    "* Both the dark and flat master frames were created through median-combining a stack of individual measurements, for which the twilight sky flats were adopted. \n",
    "* We also removed the odd–even readout pattern (along the x-axis) before the flat correction by shifting the count level of each column to a common overall level.\n",
    "* After the calibration, we obtained light curves using an aperture photometry routine again based on the IDL/DAOPHOT package. \n",
    "* To determine the centroids of WASP-19 and its comparison stars, we smoothed the defocused images into a lower resolution and fitted Gaussians to the marginal x, y distributions. \n",
    "* We also recorded the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) by fitting the wing of original point spread function, the central region of which has been masked out. \n",
    "* We carefully chose the comparison stars that were of similar brightness and well within the saturation limit. \n",
    "* The companions close to our chosen stars were masked out in case they contaminated the photometry. \n",
    "* Fluxes of these comparison stars were weighted-averaged together after self-normalization, and divided from that of WASP-19. \n",

    "# Hot Jupiter\n",
    "\n",
    "* Current theory suggests that Jovian planets form at orbital distances of & 1 AU where additional protoplanetary solids (ice) augment their formation. They then migrate inwards to become hot Jupiters. Popular theories that attempt to explain their resulting close-in orbits involve a 3rd body (in addition to the Jovian planet and it’s host star) that perturbs the orbit of the soon-to-be hot Jupiter and excites high eccentricities through either the Kozai mechanism or planet-planet scattering. This highly eccentric orbit then decays through tidal interactions into a close-in circular orbit (Nagasawa et al. 2008; Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007; Naoz et al. 2011). This scenario would produce hot Jupiters with a large range of orbital obliquities. Others suggest that hot Jupiters migrate within the circumstellar disk from which they formed through interactions with the disk (Lin et al. 1996). In this case we expect that all of the bodies would lie in coplanar orbits that are all well-aligned with the stellar spin axis. If the orbit of planet b is aligned to host star’s spin, it would suggest that this system was formed by migration rather than perturbation if the two planets are coplanar.  A coplanar and apsidally locked geometry would also allow for a precise measurement of the interior density structure of planet b (Batygin et al. 2009; Mardling 2010).\n",
    "* An emerging trend suggests that hot Jupiters around cool stars (Teff < 6250 K) with large convective envelopes tend to be better aligned with their host star’s rotation axis (Albrecht et al. 2012b). Tidal energy is most efficiently dissipated by turbulent eddies in the convective regions of stars (Zahn 2008).  As a result, the rate of tidal dissipation depends on the mass of the convective envelope. Strong tidal interactions with the convective envelope force the system into alignment in a relatively short time. Stars hotter than 6250 K have small or no convective envelopes, and it takes much longer for the system to align (Winn et al. 2010b). HAT-P-17 is a cool star with Teff~5200 K, but planet b’s orbital distance is relatively large making tidal interactions weak. According to the tidal figure of merit devised by Albrecht et al. (2012b), we would expect the tidal dissipation rate for this system to be too slow to cause obliquity damping, despite the star’s thick convective envelope. This makes HAT-P-17 an interesting test case."
